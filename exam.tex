\textbf{\large PAPER 1} \vspace{5pt} \\
\textbf{\large Before you begin read these instructions carefully}
\vspace{5pt}\\ 
Candidates should answer all questions.
\vspace{5pt}\\ 
The examination paper is divided into two sections. Each question in Section II
carries twice the number of marks of each question in Section I. Section II questions
also carry an alpha or beta quality mark and Section I questions carry a beta quality
mark.
\vspace{5pt}\\
The word limit for your examination script is 4,500 words. This includes the full text of your
answers, but not the wording of the examination questions. The examiners will not read any text
beyond the word limit of your essays.
\vspace{10pt}\\
Write on one side of the paper only and begin each answer on a separate sheet.\vspace{5pt}\\ 
Write legibly; otherwise you place yourself at a grave disadvantage.
\vspace{10pt}\\
\textbf{\large At the end of the examination:}
\vspace{5pt}\\ 
Separate your answers to each question.\vspace{5pt}\\
Complete a gold cover sheet \textbf{for each question}, and place
it at the front of your answer to that question.\vspace{5pt}\\
Complete a green main cover sheet.\vspace{5pt}\\
\textbf{Every cover sheet must also show your Blind Grade Number and desk
number.}\vspace{5pt}\\
Tie up your answers and cover sheets into \textbf{a single bundle}, with the main cover
sheet on the top, and then the cover sheet and answer for each question, in the
numerical order of the questions.\vspace{10pt}\\

\textbf{2C \ Philosophy of Counter-Strike}
\vspace{5pt} \\ (a) Summarise the main arguments given by Deano for the use of the training map \emph{Aim Rush}.

\vspace{15pt} \\
\textbf{3E \ Tilt Studies}
\vspace{5pt} \\ State the effect of Porkypus' spam binds on the enemy team's level of tilt. Justify your claim with examples.

\vspace{5pt} \\ (a) Give an example of a time you died because you didn't follow the strat, and then whiffed.
\vspace{5pt} \\ (b) Explain why the round loss was as a result of infa attempting to trade his teammate in a 2v1, with reference to the demo. Make sure to ignore your play from earlier in the round, and pin the blame entirely on infa.

\\ \textbf{\large SECTION 2}
\vspace{5pt} \\
\textbf{5E \ Tilt Studies}
\vspace{5pt} \\ With reference to the dynamic between CricGuru, infa, and kylennnnn, explain why we tilt and lose every game on FACEIT.

\textbf{6G \ Strategy, Tactics and Individual Plays}
\vspace{5pt} \\ (a) On inferno, infrw is on T side with a glock and no armour, and mistr is on CT side with an m4a1-s. infrw peeks into mistr in apartments. Calculate the peekers advantage that infrw has, in ms.
\vspace{5pt} \\ (b) Explain why this does not justify mistr's death, and subsequent ragequit.
\vspace{15pt} \\
\textbf{7C \ Philosophy of Counter-Strike}

\vspace{5pt} \\ (a) Give an example of a round loss on de\_anubis due to someone calling "they're A", when they're actually B.

\textbf{9E \ Tilt Studies}
\vspace{5pt} \\ (a) Find a game that you won, but tilted anyway because you bottom-fragged. 
\vspace{5pt} \\ (b) Use leetify to find a stat you did well in.

\vspace{5pt} \\ (d) Use this to untilt yourself ready for next game.
\vspace{15pt}\\

\vspace{5pt} \\ Critically analyse the playstyle of skelet\_man in an average CUDGS 5-stack on de\_mirage.
\vspace{5pt}\\ (a) (i) Explain why, on T side, our mid take is so weak.
\par (ii) Explain why skelet\_man should stop running up mid every round.

\par (ii) Conclude that skelet\_man should stop playing B anchor.
\vspace{15pt} \\

\vspace{5pt} \\ (b) Analyse the effectiveness of the callout "Minecraft" on de\_vertigo, with reference to its memorability, and how it removes confusion when defending bombsite B in the post-plant.
